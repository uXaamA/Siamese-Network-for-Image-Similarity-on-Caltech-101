# Siamese-Network-for-Image-Similarity-on-Caltech-101
This project implements a Siamese Neural Network using a pre-trained ResNet50 backbone to learn image similarity. The model is trained using contrastive loss on the Caltech-101 dataset and can then be used to evaluate the similarity between pairs of images.
